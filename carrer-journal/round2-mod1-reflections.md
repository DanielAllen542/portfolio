## Mod 1 reflections
### Week 1
Let's be a little honest here, my first run through module one could have been a lot better. I don't know how much I've changed at this point but I do know the error of my ways and I hope to correct that.<br>
I did well in a few things: I feel pretty good about html and css, and my layouts of the two. I feel like I have a small grasp on JavaScript and got farther in my class building than originally anticipated. <br>
Do to my own accord, I feel that I did a pretty poor job the first time around and  could have studied a little bit more on my JavaScript and actually focused completely on understanding what my code is saying. Overall I did not study nor practice what was required. So further moving forward I plan to actually apply myself. <br>
<br>
So far I've managed to come up with one goal that has a small tree of mini goals required. The initial goal overall is to apply myself, and following that is to study and code every single day. I'm going to start with a small amount every single day, but each day I will implement more and more applied time. <br>
<br>
My habits for this week will include a new routine to get me out of my comfort zone, but not too far. The goal is to do that until I actually leave the said 'comfort' zone. Considering that my current study time is at 0 and my work ethic was about a 1.5 (just look at my first mod1 journal, spoiler alert... it's blank) I figured it'd be a good idea to start small rather than attempt to study as hardcore as I can until I get unmotivated. Which happens a lot.
